# Shakespeare Programming Language
The Shakespeare Programming Language (SPL) is a programming language with source code that looks like Shakespeare's plays. The language is Turing complete, so theoretically just as powerful as any other language. It's a lot of fun to write but not very practical. More info can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_Programming_Language).

Note: Shakespeare's actual plays are not valid SPL. SPL does not aim to provide backwards compatibility with legacy code written ~400 years ago.
