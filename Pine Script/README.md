# PineScript

Pine script is a programming language created by TradingView to backtest trading strategies and create custom indicators. Pine script was designed to be lightweight, and in most cases, you can achieve your objectives with fewer lines of code compared to other programming languages.

It is not based on any particular language, but if you’ve used Python, you’ll tend to pick it up quickly and notice similarities.

Pine script code can be created within Pine editor which is a part of TradingView’s online charting platform.
